This Dockerfile is used to produce the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hledger-iadd-bin/][binary AUR package]] for Archlinux.

* Building the Image

Execute in this directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
podman build -t hledger-iadd .
#+END_SRC

* Building the binary from a release tarball

From the toplevel directory of the repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./release/arch/build_release.sh VERSION
#+END_SRC

This creates tarball and signature in the current directory.

* Uploading to Github release

1. Go to the github release in question
2. Click /Edit release/
3. Drag and drop tarball and signature file into the area below the input box
4. Click /Update release/

* Updating the AUR package

Last but not least, bump the version number in the AUR PKGBUILD, update
the checksums (from local files, not github) and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
makepkg
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
git commit -m "Bump for new release"
git push
#+END_SRC
